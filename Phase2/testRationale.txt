In our custom tests we added to Phase2App.java, we have sections of tests for calls that should work and calls that
should not. In the calls that should work, we check that we can:

* Register multiple users
* Create new K,V,M triples
    * With owner in ACL readers and writers
    * With owner gaining read and write access through indirects
    * For a key that already exists as owner
    * With two users (including owner) in ACL readers and writers
    * With another user gaining access through indirects
* Users can read...
    * Values to which they have direct access (owner and not owner)
    * Values to which they have indirect access (owner and not owner)
    * MetaValues for keys they own
* Users can write...
    * Values to which they have direct access (owner and not owner)
    * Values to which they have indirect access (owner and not owner)
    * MetaValues for keys they own
* Users can delete...
    * Keys they own
    * Nonexistant keys

In the calls that should NOT work, we check that:

* Cannot register the same username again
* Users cannot create...
    * Keys with another user listed as owner in metaVal
    * Keys that already exist if they are not the owner
    * Keys if they are not registered
* Users cannot read...
    * Values to which they do not have direct or indirect access (owner or not owner)
    * MetaValues for keys they do not own
    * Values or metaValues for keys that don't exist
    * Values or metaValues if they are not registered
* Users cannot write...
    * Values to which they do not have direct or indirect access (owner or not owner)
    * MetaValues for keys they do not own
    * Values or metaValues for keys that don't exist
    * Values or metaValues if they are not registered
* Users cannot delete keys they do not own

Our expected output, should everything run correctly, is:

To ensure proper authorization, in the Phase 2 server implementation we ensure that only users with permission
(as defined in project specs) may complete an action. Then, the bulk of the task is passed on to the Phase 1
server implementation. Similarly, in the Phase 2 stub we pass on the functionality to to the Phase 1 stub
implementation.

The following section is copied from our Phase 1 Rationale.

To provide adequate security for this K,V,M store, we signed the following objects for each method:

====Server====
* Register requests: We sign the userID, the nonce provided by the user in the request, and the status of the request.
* All non-register requests: We sign the userID, the nonce provided by the user in the request, the key, value, and
meta-value, and the outcome. For read and write requests, the value and meta-value are passed in as null by the Stub.
For read requests, we change the value or meta-value to the item read and sign the new value or meta-value.

For all requests, we re-sign the nonce provided by the Stub so that it can verify that the server is responding to the
request it just sent and no replay attack is being undertaken.

====Stub====
* Register requests: We sign the userID, a unique nonce (produced with UUID), and the user's public key.
* All non-register requests: We sign the userID, a unique nonce (produced with UUID), the type of operation (e.g.,
CREATE, READVAL, etc), and the key, value, and meta-value associated with the request. If the request is a read, value
and meta-value are null. If the request is a write, the value not being written to is null.

The nonce used when verifying server responses is always the nonce produced at the top of the method, before the request
was sent. Thus, we ensure that the response received is to the request sent.

We protect against replay attacks to the user with the unique nonce that we send in every request. If someone were to
attempt to replay a server response to the user, verification would fail since the signed nonce would not match the
nonce of their request.

We currently do not attempt to prevent replay attacks to the server because, according to the specifications, any user
can access and modify or read the K,V,M triples created by any other user. In addition, we do not attempt to prevent
man-in-the-middle attacks since intruders would not learn any information they could not learn by just registering
directly with the server.
