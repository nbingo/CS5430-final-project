# CS5430-final-project
Final project for CS 5430

To compile and build our project into a usable jar file, run the following two lines:

javac Phase0.java Phase0Impl.java Value.java
jar cf phase0.jar Phase0.class Phase0Impl.class Value.class

Then our implementation can be tested using some examples we wrote by running:

java -cp phase0.jar Phase0Impl
